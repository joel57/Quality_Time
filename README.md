# Quality Time App

**Quality Time** Take's the fight out of date night. 

The app helps you find a food recipe and a drink paring so you can enjoy time with your loved one instead of fussing over what to eat and or drink on date night. 


## How to use

To find your recipe based on a main ingredient you have on hand, type in the ingredient and click 'Get Recipe' or 'Get Drink.' Want to be completely surprised? Click 'Get Random' at the top of the page, and we'll choose for you. Let us put an end to the fight and get you back to your night!
